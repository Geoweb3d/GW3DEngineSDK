Example:  Multiple Cameras

Multiple camera in a single window example.

This example creates 1, 2, 3, and then 4 cameras in a single window

There are two methods for doing this.
- The first constructs only the necessary cameras and applies them to the window, deleting cameras when they are no longer in use.
- The second method generates all four cameras and then activates them or deactivates and updates their viewports.

The cameras will cycle through camera layouts for around 5 seconds each and then auto shutdown.
