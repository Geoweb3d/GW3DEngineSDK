BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO BUILD:

It is highly recommended that you use the Qt build provided by Geoweb3d to prevent conflicts.

If you wish to use your own Qt build:

	* From the 'View' menu on the Visual Studio toolbar, open the 'Property Manager'
	* From the Property Manager, ppen the 'Qt' property sheet
	* Click on 'User Macros'
	* Change the path for the 'QTDIR' macro to the path of your Qt build

TO INSTALL YOUR PLUGIN, add it to:

%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Geoweb3d\PluginManager.ini
